# Caleb & Amaya Wedding Website

A beautifully designed single-page wedding website inspired by a [Figma Community](https://www.figma.com/community) template. This project demonstrates modern frontend development techniques using React, Vite, and Framer Motion to deliver a smooth, elegant user experience.

## About This Project

This site was created as a personal frontend development showcase. It replicates the structure and aesthetic of a real wedding website by implementing a professional Figma design using modern tools and animations. The goal was to focus on design-to-code translation, animation handling, and layout structure using a clean React component architecture.

> **Note**: This website is currently optimized for **desktop view only**. Responsive behavior for mobile and tablet will be added in future updates.
